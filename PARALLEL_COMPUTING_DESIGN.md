## 1. Problem Statement & Computational Bottlenecks

### Core Challenge
Processing large datasets of files (100-200+ files) for categorization, content analysis, and organization becomes computationally expensive when done serially. Key bottlenecks identified:

1. **I/O Bound Operations**: File reading and metadata extraction
2. **CPU Intensive Tasks**: Content analysis, hashing, and categorization
3. **Memory Constraints**: Processing large files sequentially
4. **Scalability Limitations**: Linear time complexity with file count

### Quantitative Finance Parallel
This mirrors real-world quant challenges:
- **Backtesting**: Processing thousands of trading strategies across historical data
- **Risk Modeling**: Monte Carlo simulations across market scenarios  
- **Signal Generation**: Real-time analysis of multiple data streams
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Parallel evaluation of asset combinations

## 2. Parallel Computing Strategy

### 2.1 Parallelization Approach
**Data Parallelism with Process-Based Workers**

```python
# Core parallel processing implementation
with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=num_workers) as executor:
    future_to_chunk = {
        executor.submit(process_chunk, chunk, i): i 
        for i, chunk in enumerate(chunks)
    }
```

**Design Decisions:**
- **Process vs Thread**: Chose multiprocessing over threading to bypass Python's GIL
- **Static Load Balancing**: Files divided into equal chunks across workers
- **Shared Nothing Architecture**: Each worker processes independent file chunks

### 2.2 Load Distribution Strategy
```python
# Intelligent chunk sizing
chunk_size = max(1, file_count // num_workers)
chunks = [file_paths[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(file_paths), chunk_size)]
```

### 2.3 Performance Monitoring
Real-time tracking of:
- Individual worker processing times
- Load balance ratios
- Speedup calculations
- Efficiency metrics

#### Backend Core (`main.py`)
```python
@app.post("/analyze")
async def analyze_files(files: List[UploadFile], organize: str = Form("false")):
    """
    Main analysis endpoint with automatic serial/parallel switching
    - Threshold: 100+ files triggers parallel processing

    """
```

#### Performance Benchmarking
```python
# Real-time performance comparison
parallel_time = time.time() - parallel_start
estimated_serial_time = (serial_sample_time / sample_size) * file_count

efficiency = (speedup / num_workers) * 100
```

const theoretical = workers;
const actual = workers === data.workers_used ? perf.speedup : 
    (perf.speedup * workers) / (data.workers_used || 1);
```
